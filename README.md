# Nois Contracts

This is the development repo for the Nois contracts, including a fully featured test environment
that allows testing contract to contract IBC communication.

## The chains

There are two CosmWasm-enabled blockchains running locally.

1. **The randomness chain:** This is where randomness is verified and distributed from.
   Currently implemented using an instance of osmosisd but this could be swapped for any
   other ComsWasm chain.
2. **The app chain:** This is where the users deploy their contracts and request the
   randomness from. Currently this uses wasmd. An example for app chains in production would
   be Juno, Terra or Tgrade.

## The contracts

- nois-oracle (runs on the randomness chain; one instance globally)
- nois-proxy (runs on the app chain; one instance per app chain)
- nois-demo (runs on the app chain; a demo app)

The IBC interaction is only between nois-oracle and nois-proxy, such that
the user (nois-demo) does not need to worry about that part.

## Packages

- nois (standard library for interacting with Nois)<br />
  [![nois on crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/nois.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/nois)
- nois-protocol (the Nois IBC protocol)

## Compatibility

The nois standard library and the nois-contracts are versiones independently to avoid
unnecessary disruption for the dapp builders. The following table shows compatibility.

| nois-contracts version | nois version |
| ---------------------- | ------------ |
| 0.7.x                  | ^0.5.1       |
| 0.6.x                  | ^0.5.0       |
| 0.5.x                  | ^0.5.0       |

## Development

Follow all those steps to test things.

### Build the contracts

The repo root is a Rust workspace containing all the contracts.
Basic tests can be run like this:

```
cargo build --all-targets
cargo clippy --all-targets
cargo fmt
```

The production grade Wasm builds are compiled with:

```
#If you are running on OSX you might need to first run "brew install coreutils"
./devtools/build_integration_wasm.sh
```

### Starting/stopping the chains

In terminal 1 run:

```
./ci-scripts/osmosis/start.sh
```

which will log in `debug-osmosis.log`.

In terminal 2 run:

```
./ci-scripts/wasmd/start.sh
```

which will log in `debug-wasmd.log`.

In terminal 3 with `docker ps` you can see the running chains. `docker kill osmosis` and `docker kill wasmd` allows you to stop them.

### Run tests

The tests are written in JavaScript in the `./tests` folder

In terminal 3 run:

```
cd tests
npm install
npm run test
```

That's it ðŸŽ‰

## Production build

This is a regular CosmWasm workspace. Use the latest version of [workspace-optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer)
to build it.

```
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/workspace-optimizer:0.12.10
```
